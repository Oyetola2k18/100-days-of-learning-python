#learning more about how to import files 
# to do this: syntax is -- from {name_of_module} import *, to import object from that module

from turtle import *



# also we can also give alias to our module , like giving it another name so that it will be easy when you are calling to use the module
#to do this: syntax is-- import module as {alias},now you can call that module using  that alias

import turtle as cow

# print(type(cow.Turtle()))

#and also there are some modules that are not part of the python standard library and you have to install it yourself from a library
