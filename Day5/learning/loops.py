#learning about loops and how we can use them with lists too

# itemlists = ["yam", "beans","cassava"]

# for items in itemlists:
#     print (items)
#loops allows us to run the same line of code, multiple times
fruits = ["apple", "peach", "pear"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    print(fruit + "pie")
