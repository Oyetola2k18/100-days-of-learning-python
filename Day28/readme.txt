i will be working on building a pomodoro timer(maybe i can use it to improve my productivity)



#convas widget
in the tkinter library allows us to layer things one ontop the other(like drawing)


#also learnt about the concept of dynamic typing
#python is dynamic in a sense that if we declare a variable with a certain data type , we can overwrite the variable later on , so it would be of another type
#baically changing the content of a variable by changing it's data type
