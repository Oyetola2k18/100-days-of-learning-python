#learning about object oriented programming


#two most important things that make up an object : Its Attributes(what it has)
#and its Functions/Methods (what it does)

#we call functions ,methods in this case cuz it is a function that a particular modelled object can do

#Basically with OOP , we are trying to model real life objects and those objects have attributes and methods
